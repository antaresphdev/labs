            <p>Eva Le Queen worked as an OFW in Singapore for eight years before giving up her corporate profession to
              follow her
              dream of becoming a drag artist. During the day she would work corporate, but at night she worked as a
              drag queen.</p>
            <p>Eva won first runner-up in Singapore's Drag It Out All-Stars competition, only four months after she
              started doing
              drag. Eva's drag is inspired by literary and cinematic villains. Her strengths are in being both a comedy
              queen and
              her looks. Eva is a resident queen at Nectar Nightclub and is also one of the founders of Drag Playhouse
              PH.</p>
